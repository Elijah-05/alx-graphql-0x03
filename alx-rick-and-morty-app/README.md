## Overview

This project introduces the integration of **GraphQL** within a **React** ecosystem, using **Next.js** as the primary framework.  
The goal is to build a **Rick and Morty** application that demonstrates efficient data querying and management through GraphQL.  
As part of the setup, the project will be initialized with **TypeScript** for type safety, **ESLint** for maintaining code quality, and **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI development.  

This foundation ensures a modern, scalable, and maintainable front-end environment for further GraphQL experimentation and feature development.
